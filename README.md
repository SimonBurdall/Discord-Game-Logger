## Discord Setup

### Discord Setup | Installation and Bot Configuration

1. Install the Discord.py library by running the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
        pip install discord.py

2. Create a Discord Bot Account on the Discord Developer Portal by signing in with your Discord account. Go to the "Applications" section and click on the "New Application." Give your bot a name and click "Create."

3. In the "Bot" section, click "Add Bot" to generate a Discord token. Copy the token and paste it in the config.py file next to the discord_key variable.
    
        discord_Key = "[Discord Token]"

### Discord Setup | Application Setup and locating variables

1. Create a new Discord server just for you and the bot to make it easier to interact with the bot during logging.

2. Invite the bot to your server by clicking on the server settings, then the "Members" tab, and then the "Invite a member" button. Choose "Invite a bot," type the bot's name, select the appropriate permissions, and then click "Invite."

3. To locate your Discord user ID, go to the Discord settings and click on the "Appearance" section. Turn on the "Developer Mode" option. Right-click on your profile picture in a server and click "Copy ID." Your Discord user ID will be copied to your clipboard. Paste this into the config.py file next to the discordUser_id variable.

        discordUser_id = [Discord User ID]
