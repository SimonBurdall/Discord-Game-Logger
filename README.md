Next, create a Discord Bot Account by navigating to the Discord Developer Portal and sign in with your Discord account. Then select "Applications" section and then click on the "New Application" button. Give a name to your bot and click on the "Create" button.

Once created go to the "Bot" section and click on the "Add Bot" button. This will the generate a Discord token, copy this token and added it to the 'config.py' file next to the discord_key variable.

Then create a new Discord Server just for the bot, by click on the "+" symbol located on the left side of the screen, then click on "Create a Server." The name of the server doesn't matter.

Finally, you will need to locate your Discord user ID, this is different to your Discord username. Navigate to the Discord settings and click on the "Appearance" section. Turn on the "Developer Mode" option. Right-click on your profile picture in a server and click on "Copy ID." Your Discord user ID will be copied to your clipboard, then paste this into the 'config.py' file next to the discordUser_id variable.
